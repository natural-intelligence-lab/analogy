Each numerical file in this directory is an episode of the task. Each such file contains a json-serialized list.

The first element of this list is a serialized full state of the environment. This is a list, each element of which represents a layer in the environment state. The layer is represented as a list [k, [], [], [], ...], where k is the layer name and the subsequent elements are serialized sprites. Each serialized sprite is a list of attributes. See attributes_full.txt for the attributes contained.

The second element of the top-level list is a serialized maze, in the form of a boolean array.

The subsequent elements represent steps in the episode. Each step is a list of five elements, [[`time`, time], [`reward`, reward], [`step_type`, step_type], [`action`, action], [`meta_state`, meta_state], state].
time is a timestamp of the timestep.
reward contains the value of the reward at that step.
step_type indicates the dm_env.StepType of that step, i.e. whether it was first, mid, or last.
action contains the agent action for the step.
meta_state is the serialized meta_state of the environment.
state is a list, each element of which represents a layer in the environment state. The layer is represented as a list [k, [], [], [], ...], where k is the layer name and the subsequent elements are partially serialized sprites. Each partially serialized sprite is a list of attributes. See attributes_partial.txt for the attributes contained.
